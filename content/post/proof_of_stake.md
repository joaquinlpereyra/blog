With **The Merge** around the corner (I've read posts from 2014 starting with exactly the same sentence) I thought it would be a good time [to share something I  wrote when researching proof of stake](https://github.com/joaquinlpereyra/blog/raw/master/content/pdf/Proof%20of%20Stake.pdf).

This is basically my version of _what the heck is proof of stake and how does it work anyway_, particularly the how does it work part. It goes over Tendermint but focuses on Gasper, which is what Ethereum will implement.

[The piece](https://github.com/joaquinlpereyra/blog/raw/master/content/pdf/Proof%20of%20Stake.pdf) is intended to be kind-of-readable but still very in depth for people who already know how blockchains and proof of work function. 

It is in PDF, because damn me there are some formulas in there which I don't know how to markdown.

It is far from perfect, and at times it skews too much into _just notes for myself_. If you have any questions about it just ping me at @0xmatebabe on Twitter, we can discuss them.
