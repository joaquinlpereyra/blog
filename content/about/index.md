üëã Hey! I'm **Joaqu√≠n Pereyra**. I've been working with computers and writing about it for the better part of my life now. I'm around 30 years old and right now I live in Uruguay.

I've worked in the **information security** space since 2016, when I got my first job working on [Faraday](https://github.com/infobyte/faraday). I've since worked at [Mercado Libre](https://www.nasdaq.com/es/market-activity/stocks/meli), [Wildlife Studios](https://wildlifestudios.com/) and [IOV Labs](https://www.iovlabs.org/). 

Right now I'm working with [Coinspect](https://www.coinspect.com/) to help decentralized services be more secure. Some of our [reports](https://github.com/coinspect/publications) are public. We have done some research and education content, like talking about [wallet security on ETH Argentina](https://www.youtube.com/live/kc88CEl3vzQ?si=nJxQSHTCG8ZhaADj&t=9481) and working on reproducing [real attacks on blockchains](https://github.com/coinspect/learn-evm-attacks) to learn the techniques the bad guys have used.

Besides working I really like **a lot** of other stuff depending on my obsession at that particular moment. Some things apparently don't change that often and I seem to permanently like:

- üìñ **Books**, specially horror-adjacent and weird-fiction style. Thomas Ligotti is one of my favorite writers. 
- ü•Å **Drumming**, although I do it badly. 
- üé≤ **Games**, both on a computer and board-with-friends style.

Nevertheless I've had countless micro-hobbies and I'm usually toying around with a new one all the time. At one point it was mushrooms. Actually, _agaricus_ is just a fancy name for the common mushroom, so that explain the weird domain name. At some other point it was languages and that's why I studied around 7 of them (although I'm only fluent in Spanish and English).
